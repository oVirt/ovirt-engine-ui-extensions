== Introduction

This project contains
http://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/ux/uiplugins43.html[UI plugins]
that provides various extensions to http://www.ovirt.org/[oVirt] administration UI.

This extension is installed during oVirt Engine installation and upgraded via `engine-setup`.
This means no manual steps are required in order to install this extension in an production
environment.

== Setting up development environment

=== Prerequisites

* Install https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] (LTS). https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] can be
used to manage multiple Node.js versions. Run `node -v` to check the current Node.js version.

* Install https://yarnpkg.com/[Yarn] package manager.

* Build and configure oVirt Engine according to its
https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine#developer-mode-installation[developer instructions].

* Checkout the sources from https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-ui-extensions[GitHub].

NOTE: Required versions of `nodejs` and `yarn` can be seen in https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-ui-extensions/blob/master/packaging/spec.in[the current rpm spec template].

=== Setting up the extension

* `yarn install` to install dependencies
* `yarn lint` to lint the source code
* `yarn test` to run tests (single run)
* `yarn test:watch` for continuous testing (watch & rerun tests on change)
* `yarn dev` for development build
* `yarn dev:watch` for continuous development (watch & rebuild on change)
* `yarn build` for production build

=== Setting up Engine

Build the extension with `yarn dev` or `yarn build` to generate `${PLUGIN_REPO}/dist`.

Symlink the extension's plugin resources to `ui-plugins` directory of your developer
engine as follows:

```console
 % cd ${PREFIX}/share/ovirt-engine/ui-plugins/
 % ln -s ${PLUGIN_REPO}/dist/ui-extensions.json ui-extensions.json
 % ln -s ${PLUGIN_REPO}/dist/ui-extensions-resources ui-extensions-resources
```

Symlink the extensions's ansible resources to `playbooks` directory of your developer
engine as follows:

```console
 % cd ${PREFIX}/share/ovirt-engine/ansible-runner-service-project/project
 % ln -s ${PLUGIN_REPO}/ansible-playbooks/*
```

NOTE: If you add additional playbook yml files after the initial symlink, the
      process will need to be repeated.

=== Accessing the plugins

Open WebAdmin in your browser, you should land on *Dashboard* place automatically:

  https://engine.example:8443/ovirt-engine/webadmin/

== Internationalization and Localization

=== Introduction

This project has the ability to render in different languages. Internally, all of the localizable
keys are stored in `src/intl/messages.js`. The `msg` object in `intl-messages.js` wraps all of the
localizable keys to expose them as functions. The `msg` object also wraps all of the localized
translations loaded from `src/intl/translations.json` and uses a localized version of each key
as required.

The current locale used by the `intl.js` formatting functions is provided to the application via
the `app-init.js` service and the oVirt UI plugin API.

We use the https://zanata.ovirt.org/[Zanata] tool instance to manage translations.

=== Translation workflow

Generally, the project is made localizable and is translated in the following workflow:

* Developers add messages as needed to `src/intl/messages.js`
* Developers then import from `intl-messages.js` and use the `msg` object to both access and format the messages
* When the strings are stable, the messages are converted to a GNU gettext .pot file
* The .pot file is pushed to Zanata
* Translators do their work for each supported language within the corresponding
  https://zanata.ovirt.org/project/view/ovirt-engine-ui-extensions[Zanata project]
* When translations are complete, the localized strings are pulled from Zanata as a set of GNU gettext .po files
* The .po files are converted to a JSON file, specifically `src/intl/translations.json`
* The JSON file is referenced in `intl.js`, providing localized messages to the `msg` object in `intl-messages.js`
* Rebuilding the project will make the updated translations available for use

=== Zanata setup

Setup your Zanata configurations in the usual way. See
http://docs.zanata.org/en/release/client/[Zanata client setup documentation] for details.

=== Commands

==== Push current English source strings to Zanata

Pushing the current English sources will update the project on Zanata. Any strings that have been
added, changed or deleted will be shown as such in the Zanata UI. Here is the set of commands to
push the changes:

 % yarn intl:extract
 % yarn intl:push

==== Pull updated translations from Zanata

To properly pull and update from Zanata, the source JSON and POT files must exist. This is done by
running the `intl:extract` script. Standard zanata CLI pulls the data down as PO files. The PO
files get converted into a single JSON file containing translations for all locales. This JSON
file needs to be normalized for git diff sanity.

 % yarn intl:extract
 % yarn intl:pull
 % yarn intl:apply
 % yarn intl:normalize

== Instructions for maintainers

=== Managing dependencies

Dependencies not related to production build (not needed for `yarn build`)
should go into `devDependencies`. Try to keep as few `dependencies` as possible.

Whenever `dependencies` are changed, they need to be pre-seeded to
https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules[ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules]
for CI to pass offline builds.

See the https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules/blob/master/pre-seed/README.adoc[pre-seed documentation]
for deatils on that process.

=== Package versioning

* alpha and beta builds (pre-releases): `x.y.z-0.N` where version stays the same
* RC and GA builds (releases): `x.y.z-N` where version grows between releases

`version` in `package.json` is reflected into the RPM `x.y.z` version.

=== Release process

Only covers release builds (RC and GA).

==== Stable branches

To create new stable branch:

. create new branch on the GitHub repo
. rebase on top of the newly created branch

Then, update the master branch:

* submit pull request with following changes:
** `package.json` - bump `version`
** `packaging/spec.in` - reset `Release` number to `1` and update `%changelog`

TODO: Do any changes need to be made to copr, for builds, or a github actions, for CI, if
      a new stable branch is added?

==== Releases

To perform new release:

. switch to appropriate stable branch
. submit pull request that prepares the branch for release:
.. `package.json` - ensure proper `version` (e.g. bump `.z` component)
.. `packaging/spec.in` - ensure proper `Release` number and update `%changelog`
. pull changes from remote
. tag release-prep patch and push the tag to remote:
.. `git tag -a <tag-name>`
.. `git push origin <tag-name>`
. trigger CI build on release-prep patch
. update oVirt release config in `releng-tools` repo

Tag name example: `ovirt-engine-ui-extensions-1.0.0-1`

== Building RPM

=== GitHub pull request

GitHub actions that run CI on each pull request do a full rpm build.  To access
the RPMs for a pull request, open the checks tab.  If the offline / `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules`
check passed, the artifacts should be available on that page or on the action run's page.

=== Manual build

Alternatively, a RPM can be built locally using the `packaging/build.sh` script.  To build
online (skipping `ovirt-engine-nodejs-modules`), you will need to install the packages listed
in the `packaging/spec.in` file `BuildRequires` lines.  As of 2022-Feb-15, install:

```console
  % sudo dnf install git jq rpmlit rpm-build yarn nodejs
```

Then build with the command:

```console
  % OFFLINE_BUILD=0 ./packaging/build.sh
```

Upon a successful build, the RPMs will be located in the `exported-artifacts/` folder.
